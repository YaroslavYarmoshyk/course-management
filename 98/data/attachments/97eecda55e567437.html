Dear Students,

Congratulations on completing our lesson on &quot;Introduction to Algebra&quot;! To reinforce your understanding of the concepts we covered, please complete the following homework assignment. Take your time to solve each problem carefully and show your work for full credit.

Simplify the following expressions by combining like terms:
a) 5x + 3x - 2x
b) 7y - 2y + 3y - y
c) 2a + 4b - 3a + 5b

Solve the following equations for the given variable:
a) 2x + 7 = 15 (solve for x)
b) 3y - 5 = 16 (solve for y)
c) 4z + 9 = 25 (solve for z)

Write an algebraic expression for the following word problems:
a) The sum of a number and 8.
b) Twice the difference between a number and 5.
c) Five less than the product of a number and 3.

Evaluate the following expressions for the given values of the variables:
a) 3x^2 - 2y, when x = 4 and y = 6
b) 2a + b^2, when a = 5 and b = 2
c) 4(x + y) - 3z, when x = 2, y = 3, and z = 1    </pre>
